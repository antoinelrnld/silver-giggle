## Architecture
This project aims at containing in a single mono repo everything you need to `experiment` (train and validate
your models), and then create the Docker images you need to push these models to `production`. `packages`
is where the code used on one hand to validate models during experiments, on the other hand in production,
is tested and packaged. It is then only written once at a single place to avoid duplications.

## Experiments
### Requirements
Activate a Python 3.11 installation, then:
```
cd experiments
python -m venv venv-exp
source ./venv-exp/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-exp.txt
```

To link your venv to a Jupyter notebook kernel, run with your activated `venv-exp`:
```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=venv-exp
```
You can then use that env in an activated Jupyter notebook.

## Local Sagemaker training
```
cd experiment/train
docker build -t <train_image_name> .
docker tag <train_image_name> <github_username>/<train_image_name>:latest
docker login
docker push <github_username>/<train_image_name>:latest
python pipeline_train.py --s3-bucket-name <bucket_name> --role <role> --image-uri <github_username>/<train_image_name>:latest
```
