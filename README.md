This project aims at using MLOps best practices to create, validate NLP models on the cloud, and productionize them with an API. 

## Architecture
This single repository contains everything you need to `experiment` (train and validate
your models), and then create the Docker images you need to push these models to `production`. `packages`
is where the code used on one hand to validate models during experiments, on the other hand in production,
is tested and packaged. It is then only written once at a single place to avoid duplications.

## Experimenting
### AWS setup
Setup an AWS account, create a user, a role that can be assumed by the user and provide those credentials to GithubActions secrets for CI/CD.

### Local Sagemaker
You can verify that your pipeline runs well locally instead of doing it on expensive computes. To do so, with a Python 3.10 installation activated run:
```
cd experiment/train
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install sagemaker==2.204.0
python pipeline_train.py --role <your_role> --local True
```

### On AWS SageMaker
The run of pipelines on AWS is automated via Github Actions. See `./github/workflows/*`

## Packages
`packages` contains the code used to validate models during experiments and in production. It is tested and packaged to avoid duplications.

```
cd packages/<package_name>/src
python -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m unittest discover

```

## Production
TODO: describe how to test, build and deploy the API locally
